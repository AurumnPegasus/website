      <description>Hey, so the whole idea of me posting leetcode solutions is not because I think I can explain better than thousands of others out there. Its just a place where I write down my thoughts and explanations so that I remember different techniques I worked through :)
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/
Statement: Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Example:
Input: s = &amp;#34;abcabcbb&amp;#34; Output: 3 Explanation: The answer is &amp;#34;abc&amp;#34;, with the length 3.</description>

      <description>So I used to love ElementaryOS (still do :p) even as a programmer, since its UI was intuitive and clean, and nothing else needed to be done on top of it. During one of my assignments though, I realised the issue I was having was my OS was in Ubuntu 18.04 instead of 20.04, which was a problem. Simple enough, I tried to update it as I had tried to update by Ubuntu (you could do that simply by a command on terminal).</description>

      <description>Here is the stuff I read related to networks, different models and their working,
OSI Model The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system. It defines rules and requirements that support effortless data transfer between different products and software. In the OSI reference model, the communications between a computing system are split into seven different abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.</description>
